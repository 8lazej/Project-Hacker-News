# Project-Hacker-News

Comparison of types of posts on the internet forum **Hacker News**.

The project analyzed 2 types of posts, their precursors are:

`Ask HN` - posts in which users ask about specific issues.

`Show HN` - posts in which users share projects with each other.

It was decided to answer the questions:

* Are posts from the category `Ask HN` and `Show HN` commented on average more often than the others?
* Were posts created in a specific time period commented on average more often than at other times?
